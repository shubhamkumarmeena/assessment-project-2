        <h2> Meditation</h2>
        <p>1.Meditation is often defined as thinking continuously about one object of thought.<br>
             2.We often get stuck on this definition, however, and lose the real purpose of meditation.<br>
              3.Meditation must reveal the true nature of that object upon which we are meditating.<br>
               4.Such revelation comes not as a thought, but as a feeling. <br>
               5.Therefore, meditation is a process in which we shift from thinking to feeling.<br>
                6.It is a journey from the complexity of mind to the simplicity of heart.<br>
             7.It is for this reason that most methods of meditation involve the heart.</p><br>
